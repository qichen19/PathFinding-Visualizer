## PathFinding Visualizer

This interactive Web Application is built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. It has been deployed using Netlify and can be accessed under: https://wonderful-mestorf-c8e617.netlify.app/. Feel free to play around with it and hopefully you'll also gain more insights into those fascinating pathfinding algorithms.

## Meet PathFinding Algorithms
